## #About_me

Hello üëã, I'm Eric!, 51 years old, french, living in the Paris area.\
I'm a R&D software engineer, I've 20 years of experience in software development, in web environments.\
After a second master's degree in computer science (2021 - 2023, Paris Sorbonne University of Sciences),
I'm now a *young new ;-)* computer scientist specialized in programming languages design.

## #Current_status (2025, August)

I'm still interested in academic subjects. To go further, I'm currently working on a PhD subject!
I have a strong interest in the degrowth of programming languages and their tools.
[Lua language](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola) seems to be a good playground
(Minimalism as a main value, few core concepts enabling multi-paradigm).\
Work in progress, start as soon as possible ...

## #Side_projects

[miniml2wasm](https://github.com/epatrizio/miniml2wasm) (MiniML to WebAssembly compiler) is a personal experimental project.\
It's always difficult to write a compiler, so, this project, written in OCaml, allows me to experiment.
Next, It gives me a better understanding of ML languages (e.g. strong static typing, inference)
and the Wasm bytecode.

I continue to contribute to `ola` (Ocaml LuA interpreter, another personal project)
and I'm always close to `owi` üêå (WebAssembly Swissknife & cross-language bugfinder, an OCamlPro project).
