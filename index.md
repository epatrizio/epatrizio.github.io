## #Current_status (2024, January)

I work at [OCamlPro](https://ocamlpro.com), a private research lab.
I contribute to the [owi](https://github.com/OCamlPro/owi/) 🐌 project
(OCaml WebAssembly toolchain : concrete and symbolic interpretation),
part of a research project on OCaml to Wasm compilation based on [WasmGC](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc)
(WebAssembly new version, including Garbage Collection support).

## #Side_project

[ola](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola/) (OCaml Lua experiments) is a personal experimental project.
First step, `ola` is a Lua language interpreter written in OCaml.
The objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of dynamic languages design, such as typing at runtime.

The project begins (2023, September), I've already learned a lot, more than I expected.
The most important thing is that it requires a **hard** work to implement
the full language specification, including the standard library.
You want to learn and have fun with me, feel free, contact me,
[Issues and Pull Requests](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola/issues) are welcome !
