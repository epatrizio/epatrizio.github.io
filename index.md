## #Current_status (2024, January)

I work at [OCamlPro](https://ocamlpro.com), a private research lab.
I contribute to the [owi](https://github.com/OCamlPro/owi/) üêå project
(OCaml WebAssembly toolchain : concrete interpretation and symbolic interpretation),
part of a research project on OCaml to Wasm compilation based on WasmGC
(WebAssembly new version, including Garbage Collector support).

## #Side_project

[ola](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola/) (Ocaml LuA experiments) is a personal experimental project.
First step, ola is a Lua language interpreter written in OCaml.
The objective is to have a deeper understanding of dynamic languages, such as typing at runtime.

The project begins, I've already learned a lot, more than I expected.
The most important thing is that it requires a hard work to implement
the full language specification, including the standard library.
You want to have fun with me, feel free !
